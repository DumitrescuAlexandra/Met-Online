This is a task I received during an intervew process.

Basically they asked me to consume a REST-API (The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API) to get a list of all Vincent Van Gogh's highlights.

Also, for each artwork I had to display a small image of it, title and the date.

I tried to take it a bit further and practice my design skills as well :).

Here are some captions from the process:
